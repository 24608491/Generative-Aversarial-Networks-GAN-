# Generative-Aversarial-Networks-GAN-

The algorithm below was developed in R-Studio using keras and tensorflow  and an it tries to generate the number 3 (from the MNIST training dataset). 
The generator layer of the neural network architecture generates random noise while the discriminator compares the noise from the generator with digit 3 from the training set to determine whether the noise is fake  or not. The generator in return improves by trying to trick the discriminator. 

The uploaded picture shows the results on how the noise ultimatley becomes the number 3 with continous training.
